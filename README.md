# Responsive Portfolio

## Project status
Development for this project is on pause, for now.

## Description
A challenge for myself to build a basic portfolio page which I can add to as my skills in wed development progress. The page showcases my skills aquired to date, my completed projects and different ways to find out more about me and my work. At the moment it is just a shell of a portfolio, but it is designed and written to be accessible and adaptable for future me to be able to clearly understand it, add to it and alter it as my projects and skillset evolve. It provides links to specific projects and the skills involved. As a web application in its own right, many of the CSS and html tools I have learned so far are demonstrated on the main page.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
The title shows the name of the student whose portfolio it is. The header bar features links which can be used to navigate the sections within the page, including an 'About Me' section, a previous work section and a section with ways of contacting the student. Navigating to each section, the sections are expanded upon with content, visual aids and links. The web application has been adapted to be used at different viewport scales, from monitors & laptops, to tablets, to mobile phones.

## Contributing
As this is a personal project, designed to challenge and test my skills, I am not currently looking for contributors. However, there may be a opening for this in the future.
